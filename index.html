            This site is a giant bulletin board, where you can chat and share images.
            Posts are automatically sent to the top (bumped) after a new comment. 
            You can even make your own categories and post about something completely different! 
            To upload an image, just put the filename in the box by your message. 
            If it's bigger than 200px by 200px, it'll automatically be resized.
            Please be aware that the maximum size for an image is 2MB, and only one per post [if you need more, post again!].
            If you're stuck with the board, just post something - anywhere!

            Weird things happen here.
            Past this point I cannot be certain of anything being family friendly (explicit language and images), legal, or many other things. 
            If you are unsure about being here, leave now! 
            You won't regret it. 
            That's a promise. 
            You won't know about what's going on here however...
            You won't know about the weird things that happen here.
            Unless you click the button below. 
            But if you're going to press it, please read the rest of this page NOW.

					Be safe online (be safe offline to ;-). 
            Do not give out personal details (name, address, date of birth, etc) about yourself or others.
            Do not post images that could give away your identity or the idenitites of others.
            Do not post your passwords or other sensitive information. I certainly don't need them. 
            You don't even need to register to post on the boards, so I won't take your passwords or email addresses unless you give them to me. 
            Any information you post could be browsed by spammers, scammers, search robots, identity stealers etc etc. 
            Only post information that you want them to know.
            If you do not want them to have that information, do not give it to them.
            This applys to other websites too (I <i>stress</i>, <b>you should do this for banking websites, and social networking sites</b> [e.g. myface... or what ever it is]).
            If you want, feel free to use an anonymising proxy to browse and post, or take someone else's name for a post or two (but I ask you, why?). 
            Remember, you are not required to post (you'd be better off not posting), and your contribution may or may not be wanted, needed, or respected...

					Please try to use good (or even better, great) spelling and grammar as posts cannot be edited. 
            You'll look like an idiot otherwise.
