            This site is a giant bulletin board, where you can chat and share images.
            Posts are automatically sent to the top (bumped) after a new comment. 
            You can even make your own categories and post about something completely different! 
            To upload an image, just put the filename in the box by your message. 
            If it's bigger than 200px by 200px, it'll automatically be resized.
            Please be aware that the maximum size for an image is 2MB, and only one per post [if you need more, post again!].
            If you're stuck with the board, just post something - anywhere!

					Most of the content here will be user generated. 
            Past this point I cannot be certain of anything being family friendly (explicit language and images), legal, or many other things. 
            If you are unsure about being here, leave now! 
            You won't regret it. 
            That's a promise. 
            You won't know about what's going on here unless you click the button below. 
            But if you're going to press it, please read the rest of this page NOW.

					Be safe online. 
            Do not give out personal details (name, address, date of birth, etc) about yourself or others.
            Don't post images that could give your identity or the idenitites of others away.
            Do not post your passwords or other sensitive information. I certainly don't need them. 
            Any information you post could (probably) be browsed by spammers, scammers, identity stealers etc etc. 
            You don't even need to register to post on the boards, so I won't take your passwords or email addresses. 
            If you want, feel free to use an anonymising proxy to browse and post, or take someone else's name for a post or two (but I ask you, why?). 
            Remember, you are not required to post, and your contribution may or may not be wanted, needed, or respected... but it's unlikely that it will be removed (not impossible).

				<div class="foot">
					Please try to use good (or even better, great) spelling and grammar as posts cannot be edited. 
            You'll look like an idiot otherwise.
