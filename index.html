            This site is a giant bulletin board, where you can chat and share images.
            Posts are automatically bumped after a new comment.
            You can even make your own categories and post about something completely different!
            To upload an image, just put the filename in the box by your message.
            If it's bigger than 500px by 200px, it'll automatically be resized.
	    Files can be uploaded too. However, they are not checked for harmful material.
            Please be aware that the maximum size for uploads are 2MB, and only one upload per post [if you need more, post again!].
	    If you have a gravatar, put your gravatar email address at the end of the name field. 
	    Note that your email address will not be stored in the database, only the md5sum.
	    If you upload an image, your gravatar will not be shown.
            If you're stuck with the board, just post something - anywhere!

            Weird things happen here.
            Past this point I cannot be certain of anything being family friendly (explicit language and images), legal, or many other things.
            If you are unsure about being here, leave now!

            Be safe online (be safe offline to ;-).
            Do not give out personal details (name, address, date of birth, etc) about yourself or others.
            Do not post images that could give away your identity or the idenitites of others.
            Do not post your passwords or other sensitive information. I certainly don't need them.
            Any information you post could be browsed by spammers, scammers, search robots, identity stealers etc etc.
            Only post information that you want them to know.
            If you do not want them to have that information, do not give it to them.
            If you want, feel free to use an anonymising proxy to browse and post, or take someone else's name for a post or two (but I ask you, why?).
            Remember, you are not required to post (you'd be better off not posting), and your contribution may or may not be wanted, needed, or respected...
