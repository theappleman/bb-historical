					Most of the content here will be user generated. Past this point I cannot be certain of anything being family friendly (explicit language and images), legal, or many other things. If you are unsure about being here, leave now! You won't regret it. That's a promise. My guarantee... although, this is computers we're talking about - all sorts of things can happen. You won't know about what's going on here unless you click the button below. But if you're going to press it, please read the rest of this page NOW.

				<div class="text">
					Be safe online. Do not give out personal details (name, address, date of birth, etc) about yourself or others. Do not post your passwords or other sensitive information. I certainly don't need them. Any information you post could (probably) be browsed by spammers, scammers, identity stealers etc etc. You don't even need to register to post on the boards, so I won't take your passwords or email addresses. If you want, feel free to use an anonymising proxy to browse and post, or take someone else's name for a post or two (but I ask you, why?). Remember, you are not required to post, and your contribution may or may not be wanted, needed, or respected... but it's unlikely that it will be removed (not impossible).
				</div>
				
				<div class="foot">
					Please try to use good (or even better, great) spelling and grammar as posts cannot be edited. You'll look like an idiot otherwise.

					If you're stuck with the board, just post something - anywhere! (well... almost) Posts are automatically sent to the top after a new comment. LC means latest comment, so you can see what the last person said. You can even make your own categories and post about something completely different! The system supports image uploading (max size 2MB, one per post [if you need more, post again!]), just put the filename in the box below your message. Some knowledge of HTML (more specifically, anchors and line breaks) would be helpful when posting. Not necessary, of course!

					Thanks for visiting and have fun! Or else...
