					Be safe online. Do not give out personal details (name, address, date of birth, etc) about yourself or others. Do not post your passwords or other sensitive information. I certainly don't need them. You don't even need to register to post on the boards. If you want, feel free to use an anonymising proxy to browse and post.

					If you're stuck with the board, just post something - anywhere! (well... almost) Posts are automatically sent to the top after a new comment. LC means latest comment, so you can see what the last person said. You can even make your own categories and post about something completely different!
